## Comments

### HTML
There were some conversations on Twitter this past weekend that HTML is not a programming language.
I don't care about semantics, but I **DO** care to recognize people that write HTML as developers.

My first full-time job I wrote code to solve problems even though I didn't have "developer" in my title.
I automated a job that used to take 3 weeks down to 3 hours with the code I wrote.
It just so happened that my IDE was Excel.

### Systems Architecture
I spent a lot of time this past week talking to people about applications they've built and run.
It's great to hear about design and trade-offs for things I've never worked on and failure modes I've never had to consider.
I'll be posting the conversations on YouTube in the coming weeks.

I wrote down my setup for remote whiteboarding.
I'm using an open source app which fit's my needs for simplicity and a friendly pen interface.
I address a lot of other options and when you might want to use them in the post.

I never read comics growing up, but lately I've been learning a lot about visual story telling.
From Julia's blog—link from last weeks email—I found Understanding Comics book and I've already read it and learned a ton!
