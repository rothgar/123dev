### Do you know how to say no?

People often feel guilty for saying no to opportunities, but in reality you should say no when you really care about something but know you are not the best person.
It doesn't matter if you're not interested, if you don't have enough time, or you don't have the right skills.
If you understand saying no will make the project/event/collaboration/etc. more successful then you can better position yourself to say no and explain why.

I can imagine the guy in the gif originally thought he was helping by saying yes to this.
It looks like everything worked out well... for the person throwing the ball.

You should `curl -sL http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash` this link first and then wget the link to read the source.
Bash, embedded python, and audio if you're on Linux â€” assuming your audio is working. :)
Pretty amazing.

If you like ruby syntax but want something that can be compiled into a portable binary crystal looks like it could be a good fit.
I've never written anything in it, but I've been watching it for a while.
Great to see them release 1.0. ðŸŽ‰

I love Terraform.
It can do a lot of things really well and with all of the provider plugins it's really easy to get started.
I completely agree with this article that you shouldn't be deploying your applications with Terraform.

As much as some people want to stick with the tool they're familiar with, Terraform can deploy software but you're going to hit a lot of limitations.
You can try to mask those limitations or orchestrate Terraform apply commands with Jenkins.
In reality you should use a different tool.
