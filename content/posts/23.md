### Nostalgia technology

Looking back at old technology products most of the time I think how bad they were.
Occasionally, I remember something I really liked and I wish I could have it again.
But then I realize the products were good at the time but probably would hold back innovations in ways I couldn't predict.

Much like this car jack which seems like a great idea!
Takes up minimal amount of space, self inflates, and probably about as safe as scissor jacks are today.
But when you think about it maybe if we all had self inflating car jacks the electric car would have one more obstacle to overcome.

### Manual understanding

This week I was working on content for a new workshop and I had to add an EC2 instance to an ALB manually.
It dawned on me I never had to do that before and I didn't actually know the steps required.
I hope I don't have to do it again but I'm thankful I did because I'm sure it'll help me troubleshoot automation in the future.

## Links

There's some really good nuggets of wisdom here.
There's also some not great advice and quite a bit of bias.
I didn't read all the comments but the OP's content is worth looking through.

A thorough, 5-part walk through of DNS lookups on Linux.
Covering everything from config files, to NetworkManager, and even Kubernetes.
Worth a read if you've ever been curious how it works.

I learned a lot of new things while making the site for this newsletter.
It's not super deep technical stuff but it still took me a few weeks to troubleshoot and get things working exactly as I wanted.
I wrote a lot of it down here and have one more blog draft I hope will be ready soon.
