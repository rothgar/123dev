### Survival
In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best to their environment.

You may think that quote is from Charles Darwin but it is actually a misquote. I'll let you do your own homework to find the true author.

### Why the cloud
Many people use the cloud for different reasons. Maybe it's for features, for scale, or for cost. Blockbuster had lots of movies, they had scale, and they gave lots of people value compared to going to a movie theater. They had plenty of opportunity to adapt but couldn't. One major reason was the debt they accrued planning, building, and stocking 5000+ stores.

I saw multiple people arguing that the cloud is more expensive than on-prem and I could only think that's not the point. Even if I'm able to keep hardware long past its support cycle and squeeze every last electron through its transistors if my needs ever change or the environment in which I offer value moves on and I cannot adapt I'm done.

The biggest value to me in using the cloud is your ability to adapt.

## Links

I didn't know HTTP was going to get a new method! SEARCH (proposed) sounds like it could solve some real world limitations with existing methods. Normally I would link to the spec, but this article did a good job of explaining why it's needed.

My co-worker showed me this a few weeks ago and already it has saved me a **ton** of time. Not only does this do OS and brew updates but it also handles way more like vscode, vim. and tmux plugins. Well worth an install.

Little tools like this make me smile. You'll probably never use it beyond playing with it and the one time you need it you'll forget all about it. Still, it has some really handy features like viewing command args and open network connections. Both available in `/proc` but this is easier to remember.
